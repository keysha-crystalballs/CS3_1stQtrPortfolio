  Before reading an article about the SONA 2025, our Filipino teacher, Sir Mon, discussed about “Retorika”. He taught us that rhetoric means persuading others, especially through speech.
He also said that we usually do these in our everyday lives. Now that I’ve finished reading and analyzing, here are my thoughts and my reflection: 

  I find that most of BBM’s points are promising since it can help individuals. As a Taekwondo athlete and a beginner gymnast, the support for sports made me happy as I feel like we haven’t shown our full potential in terms of sports. 
Even though this is promising, will all of these happen? Most of the things seem too complicated to achieve, such as the 200 new power plants. I also find most of the things rhetorical, especially the rice decreasing to the price of 20 pesos and the zero-balance billing in hospitals. 
The SONA made me realize that you need to be a responsible leader so you can come up with ideas to help people, promise it, and fulfill it. We aren’t close to fulfilling these promises, but hopefully this can happen in the future.

**2. What 1 word/ phrase/ or sentence do you have for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025?** 

Rhetorical
