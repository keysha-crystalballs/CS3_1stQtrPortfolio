# My Q1 Reflections ദ്ദി(˵ •̀ ᴗ - ˵ ) ✧


## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.


1. **Variable Declaration** - This is one of the most basic things to know in any JS code. I learned how to properly define my variables, for instance, by making the variable a string, an integer, or a boolean. 
2. **Arithmetic Operators** - With the help of basic mathematical concepts, I understand how it would work in code. It's like doing simple math, but it's done on a computer.
3. **If-else statements** - This is a very familiar topic to me. During CS2, this is commonly used in Ma'am Edlen's exercises in C++.
4. **For Loops** - This loop has been commonly practiced during Grade 8. I understand how for loops work, and there are many practice exercises provided, which helped me further understand the concept. 
5. **While and Do-while Loops** - Just like the other two loops, this is commonly practiced with Ma’am Edlen. I can say that I am confident with these loops, and I can apply them here in JavaScript.


## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed. 


1. **JavaScript overview and Syntax** - Generally, I'm still getting used to JavaScript. Sometimes, I keep forgetting that the syntax is not the same as C++. I am still slightly confused about what the script element does.
2. **JavaScript basic statements** - I'm still slightly confused about what the differences are between each basic statement. The prompt() and confirm() I haven't tried using these yet, so I haven't dived into this part.
3. **Commonly Used JavaScript Number Objects** - Personally, I think that this topic needs further discussion. This wasn't used in the exercises given.
4. **Event Handlers** - This hasn't been completely discussed. I am not familiar with these.
5. **Functions** - This was discussed during Grade 8, but I am sometimes confused because I am not sure when to use 'return'. This also hasn't been practiced much in the exercises.


## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further understand the topics listed on the second item.


**Plans of Action:**
- Consult, ask help from Ma'am, from classmates, or my cousin (her major is IT) to help understand the topics further.
- Search for practice exercises online to try these topics. One example could be asking Chat GPT for practice codes or using Code Chef.
- Watch YouTube videos about the topics I am confused about.


## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?


**Effective activities**
- Kahoot exercises. This helps me know if I understand the topic well, while also making it fun for everyone.
- Graded exercises. This taught me to explore GitHub more, and this also helped me review some of the topics, such as loops.


**Least Effective activities**
- Take-home non-graded activities. Sometimes I keep forgetting that those exist, and sometimes I feel left behind during class.
- Doing speed tests. Most of the speed tests that I've done so far, I haven't gotten any of them. I usually leave the classroom in confusion and wonder how I could've gotten it.
